# Welcome to the QA Recruitment Task

This task is aimed at testing how you approach problems, it is not aimed to test your skill level.

At [Geomiq](https://geomiq.com/) we focus on solving problems and investing in people, we like to think this is represented well in this task.

You can read the full breakdown and instructions of the task [on notion here](https://geomiq.notion.site/QA-Recruitment-Task-31a40ad197ca457f8e2f7c15fbe6d75d).

As with when you are working in a company, it is ok to ask questions! 

Good luck, and may the odds ever be in your favour.
